    * **Data source:** Nfl-data-py
    * This page highlights the EPA and WPA for each play in a given game, including separate tables highlighting the top 10 plays for EPA and WPA
    * Full play descriptions are given in the play by play table
    * The chart plots the offensive and defensive EPA for each team in the year selected

    **Run/Pass Predictor**
    * A tool powered my machine learning to predict the play and play location based on pre snap conditions
    * **Data source:** Nfl-data-py
    * Uses the Gradient boosting classifier from the Scikit-Learn python library
    * The model is trained on pre snap conditions over the last 5 year of play by play data with the target being a run or pass play, and the location of the field that the play is directed towards based on the tendencies of that team over time
    **Model accuracy by down**
    * 1st - 62.41%
    * 2nd - 67.32%
    * 3rd - 82.61%
    * 4th - 80.24%

**Expected Points Added:**
* Measures how well a team performs relative to expectation by assigning a point value to each play
**Win Probability Added:**
* Win probability added after the play for the team with posession
**QB EPA per Dropback:**
* Expected points added for the individual QB divided by their total dropbacks within a game
**Average Cushion:**
* The distance (in yards) measured between a WR/TE and the defender they‚Äôre lined up against at the time of snap on all targets
**Average Separation:**
* The distance (in yards) measured between a WR/TE and the nearest defender at the time of catch or incompletion
**Avg YAC Above Expectation:**
* Average yards after catch above expectation
**8+ Defenders in the Box:**
* On every play, Next Gen Stats calculates how many defenders are stacked in the box at snap. Using that logic, DIB% calculates how often does a rusher see 8 or more defenders in the box against them
